My personal website, to be hosted via AWS

## NOTES ##
This site retrieves the latest articles that I would like to share from a JS file called `latest.js`. This repo will ignore that file for now because it is auto-generated by s3 and manipulated via lambda.

For local development, it is recommended to ensure that
- `.gitignore` will ignore that file
- For testing values, populate the array as
```
const latest_json = [{
    source: <string>, // where the article was found
    title: <string>, // the title of the article
    url: <string>, // the link to the article
}
...]
```
